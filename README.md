# [Project 1: Analyzing the Geography of Countries and Their Capitals](https://github.com/Jonnyboyy808/Country_and_Capital_Geography-)
- Data scraped from http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals.
- The first part of the project included putting the data into Pandas dataframes and was analyzed on various things including a capitals distance to a coast, which countries are most landlocked, the countries with the highest/lowest birth/death rates, and capital population density. 
- In the second half of the project, the dataframes were dumped into a SQLite database to be queried and visualized on several things, including the number of countries per continent, population per continent, highest/lowest GDP per country, and interesting scatterplots, such as phone usage on GDP per capita or GDP per capita on literacy rates. 
- Python, Juptyer, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used
