# Projects (Reverse Chronological)

Project 1: Parse a CSV file on FIFA player data to return information regarding indiviudal player's stats or aggregated information of all players based on keys like country or jersey number. This project was right before venturing into Pandas, so all of the work was done was without Pandas or SQL.

Project 8 objective: Write functions that return dictionaries, which maps IDs (keys) to their names (values). Parse lists of dictionaries. Bucketize dictionaries into "buckets" of dictionaries, sorted by different elements. 

Project 9 objective: Analyze reviews of Amazon projects that is spread across multiple files, where some are CSVs and others JSON. The files will contain missing values or be too corrupt to parse. Additionally, clean the data, represent it as review objects, analyze and plot all results. 

Project 10 objective: Write code to scrape data from a webpage, save it in JSON format, load the data to Pandas DataFrames and analyze it. Then, dumb the DataFrames into a SQLite database and write queries to answer questions. Often, the answer will be in the form of a plot.
